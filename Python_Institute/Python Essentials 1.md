The four simple actions that form a **program**:
- accept a number representing the distance;
- accept a number representing the travel time;
- divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
- display the result (representing the average speed) in a readable format.

A complete set of known commands is called an **instruction list**.

Elements of a language:
- **alphabet**: set of symbols used to build words of a certain language
- **lexis/dictionary**: set of words the language offers its users
- **syntax**: set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence
- **semantics**: set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense

**COMPILATION** - the source program is translated once; you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a **compiler** or translator.
**INTERPRETATION** - translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an **interpreter**.
