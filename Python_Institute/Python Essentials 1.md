> Programming - absolute basics  
  

The four simple actions that form a **program**:
- accept a number representing the distance;
- accept a number representing the travel time;
- divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;
- display the result (representing the average speed) in a readable format.

A complete set of known commands is called an **instruction list**.

Elements of a language:
- **alphabet**: set of symbols used to build words of a certain language
- **lexis/dictionary**: set of words the language offers its users
- **syntax**: set of rules used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence
- **semantics**: set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense

**COMPILATION** - the source program is translated once; you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a **compiler** or translator.   (compilation might take some time to complete after each change in the code and compiled program needs to be compatible with all the devices intended to run it, but it should run smoothly and fast once compiled)  
**INTERPRETATION** - translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an **interpreter**.  
(it won't run as fast as a compiled program and all end-users need to have the interpreter installed, but you can run the code as soon as you complete it and it can be run on computers using different machine languages)
